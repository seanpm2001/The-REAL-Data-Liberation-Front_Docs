# The REAL Data Liberation Front Documentation

`🗄️⚖️📖️🔀️ The documentation source repository for the REAL Data Liberation Front.`

**🏠️ Home repository:** [:octocat: `The REAL Data Liberation Front`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/The-REAL-Data-Liberation-Front/)

## Documentation

Documentation is located [`here (/Docs/)`](/Docs/) for now, there isn't much to document, except for this:

> **Note** Google shouldn't go after this, as they abandoned their efforts for nearly a decade now. It is time to let someone actually take over and try to do something, instead of continuing to let them squat here.

**Goals:**

- Openness (an open format and standard)
- Longer takeout times (1 month, instead of 1 week)
- Open takeout formats (an open data takeout format)
- Advocating better data takeout on websites (users should be able to download specifically what they want from their accounts with no restriction)
- Compliance for full data takeouts across various websites (every byte and bit should be retrievable by the user upon request, with no delay, and no fees or restrictions)

Yes the name has some spite, but the project itself doesn't

**Spite:**

1. Google has messed up world efforts on data takeout and has done nothing with their "Data Liberation Front" since 2013 (over 10 years before this project was started)
2. Google steamrolled over Francis McCabes `Go!` (2003) programming language in 2009 with their `Go` programming language, which gave no mention to Francis McCabe, and became too popular, while his language is still not even one of the top 1000 languages by usage. If they can steamroll over someone, they should have something of theirs steamrolled
3. Google is a threat to the world
