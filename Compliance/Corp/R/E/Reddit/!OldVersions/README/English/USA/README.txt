## [Hostile authorization](#Hostile-authorization)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `❌️ Failure`

Data takeout is hidden, and designed to discourage users from doing so. Data takeout is not within any Reddit settings, but in a separate link in a forum post, where you have to send a request. This request is worded like it can take a month or longer, and possibly not even go through. Additionally, it requires you to specify if you live in California or the European Union, but has an `other` option. One positive thing is that you can specify how much data you want (you can specify a time period of data that you want, which defaults to 2 months, or your entire account history)

## [One month takeout time](#One-month-takeout-time)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `❌️ Failure`

Data can only be taken out for 1 week.

## [Standard format](#Standard-format)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>
