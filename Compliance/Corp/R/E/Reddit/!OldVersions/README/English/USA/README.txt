## [Fees](#Fees)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `✅️ Success`

Data can be taken out without a fee.

</details>

---

## [Takeout](#Takeout)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `✅️ Success`

Data takeouts are possible, although they take quite a long time.

</details>

---

## [Takeout in full](#Takeout-in-full)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `❌️ Failure`

Data cannot be taken out in full. All metadata, post, account, and text data can be taken out, but images and videos cannot, and the data takeout is not in a very accessble format, although it still is a standard format.

</details>

---

## [Hostile authorization](#Hostile-authorization)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `❌️ Failure`

Data takeout is hidden, and designed to discourage users from doing so. Data takeout is not within any Reddit settings, but in a separate link in a forum post, where you have to send a request. This request is worded like it can take a month or longer, and possibly not even go through. Additionally, it requires you to specify if you live in California or the European Union, but has an `other` option. One positive thing is that you can specify how much data you want (you can specify a time period of data that you want, which defaults to 2 months, or your entire account history)

</details>

---

## [One month takeout time](#One-month-takeout-time)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `❌️ Failure`

Data can only be taken out for 1 week.

</details>

---

## [Standard format](#Standard-format)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `✅️ Success`

Data can be taken out in a standard format. A ZIP file is given that consists entirely of CSV files.

Standard formats include, but are not limited to:

```plain-text
JSON, MP4, MP3, ZIP, TXT, JS, CSS, HTM, HTML, ODT, PDF, XML, SVG, OGG, OGA, PNG, JPG, GIF, JP2, JPE, ISO, YAML, EPUB, OGV, WEBM, MKV, ODS, ODP, ODB, SQL
```

Standard formats must have high levels of recognition, and cannot be a special format created by the owner of the site, unless said format is an international recognized ISO standard.
