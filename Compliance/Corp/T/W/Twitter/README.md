## Fees

Data can be taken out without any financial information input, or payments

## Takeout

Data can be taken out, a 33 MiB data takeout took exactly 24 hours.

## Takeout in full

Data takeout can be done in full, and offline functionality is incredibly good. All media is archived, along with tweets, likes, follows, etc. and is completely browser friendly offline.

## Hostile authorization

As of 2023, June 1st, Twitter requires you to enter credentials multiple times before getting to the data takeout page, and will repeatedly ask for credentials each time you reload the page to check the status. Although the ability to ask whether you want to verify with either email or text message is helpful.

## One month takeout time

The user is only given 1 week to take out data, as of 2023, June 1st.

## Standard format

Data can be taken out in a standard format.

Standard formats include, but are not limited to:

```plain-text
JSON, MP4, MP3, ZIP, TXT, JS, CSS, HTM, HTML, ODT, PDF, XML, SVG, OGG, OGA, PNG, JPG, GIF, JP2, JPE, ISO, YAML, EPUB, OGV, WEBM, MKV, ODS, ODP, ODB, SQL
```

Standard formats must have high levels of recognition, and cannot be a special format created by the owner of the site, unless said format is an international recognized ISO standard.

## Opinion and motivation

Twitter is my first takeout target after starting this project. Although I don't have much hope for Twitter right now, this takeout helps to establish some of the goals and boundaries of this project, and serves as a first data point. This data is as of 2023, Thursday, June 1st. There is always the chance that Twitter can improve, even under its current owner, so I am now establishing the preceent of being open to all platforms, regardless of management.

I am starting with Twitter, as I am currently downloading an archive of my Twitter account, so that I can then let the account fall dormant. I was motivated, as Twitter has started to delete dormant accounts.
