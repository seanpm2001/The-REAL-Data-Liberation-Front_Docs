## [Fees](#Fees)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `❌️ Failure`

Data can not be taken out at all, so this test failed by default.

## [Takeout](#Takeout)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

> **Status:** `❌️ Failure`

Data cannot be taken out at all through the site, a 3rd party tool is required, and there is likely to be hostility involved in this method, as Quora has made it clear they do not want to be transparent.
