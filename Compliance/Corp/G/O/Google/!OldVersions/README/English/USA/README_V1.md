## Hostile authorization

Google does not become hostile when it comes to data takeouts, as of 2023, June 1st

## One month takeout time

Google limits you to 1 week of time to takeout your data, which is not good for major or medium content creators, especially those with poorer Internet speeds, higher costs, or datacaps. as of 2023, June 1st

## Standard format

Google data can be taken out in a standard format, as of 2023, June 1st

Standard formats include, but are not limited to:

```plain-text
JSON, MP4, MP3, ZIP, TXT, JS, CSS, HTM, HTML, ODT, PDF, XML, SVG, OGG, OGA, PNG, JPG, GIF, JP2, JPE, ISO, YAML, EPUB, OGV, WEBM, MKV, ODS, ODP, ODB, SQL
```

Standard formats must have high levels of recognition, and cannot be a special format created by the owner of the site, unless said format is an international recognized ISO standard.

## Opinion and motivation

Google is the second target for data takeout entries. I am starting with all of the services in which I can attempt data takeout. Google comes second. I am hoping I can further standardize my results with this entry.
