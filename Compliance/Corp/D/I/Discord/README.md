## [Takeout in full](#Takeout-in-full)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

Data takeout cannot be done in full. While a lot of data can be taken out, media, such as images or videos posted within a server are not included in the takeout, while everything else is. The majority of data is in JSON and CSV format, and would require a special 3rd party program to read and render it properly.
